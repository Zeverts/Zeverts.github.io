      <description>It almost goes without saying, but pitchers are the most important position in baseball. A pitcher’s performance is almost directly responsible for the outcome of any game, I mean, you can’t lose if you don’t give up runs. So every year it becomes a debate of who is the most dominant pitcher in the Majors. I decided to give this question a look and find the best MLB pitcher since the implementation of league-wide StatCast technology.</description>

      <description>The Colorado Rockies aren’t typically known for their pitching prowess but for their ability to hit. The 2019 season was no exception with the Rockies having statistically one of the worst bullpens. The Rockies gave up the most hits and subsequently had the second-highest ERA in the MLB. For most teams, it would be easy to place all the blame on the pitching staff but the Rockies have a big factor lurking in the altitude of Coors Field.</description>
