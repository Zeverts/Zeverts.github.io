      <description>The Colorado Rockies arenâ€™t typically known for their pitching prowess but for their ability to hit. The 2019 season was no exception with the Rockies having statistically one of the worst bullpens. The Rockies gave up the most hits and subsequently had the second-highest ERA in the MLB. For most teams, it would be easy to place all the blame on the pitching staff but the Rockies have a big factor lurking in the altitude of Coors Field.</description>
